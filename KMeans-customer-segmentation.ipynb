    "K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

    "It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.<br>\n",
