    "K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties.\n",
    "It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes the unlabeled dataset as input, divides the dataset into k-number of clusters, and repeats the process until it does not find the best clusters. The value of k should be predetermined in this algorithm. <br>\n",

    "Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.<br>\n",
    "Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-center, create a cluster.\n",
    "Hence each cluster has datapoints with some commonalities, and it is away from other clusters.<br>\n",
