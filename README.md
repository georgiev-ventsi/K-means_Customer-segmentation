   * Step-1: Data pre-processing
   * Step-2: Visualization of the distribution by gender in our data
   * Step- 3: Represent the distribution based on ‘Age’, ‘Annual income’ and ‘Spending score’
   * Step-4: Divide the 'Age' into groups for better visualization and better analysis
   * Step-5: Analise the relationship between the ‘Annual Income’ and the ‘Spending Score’
   * Step-6: Divide the ' Spending score' into groups and visualize
   * Step-7: Divide the 'Annual Income' into groups and visualize
   * Step-8: Make groups based on ‘Age’ and ‘Spending Score’
   * Step-9: Make groups based on ‘Annual Income’ and ‘Spending Score’
   * Step-10: Target customers by Age, Annual Income and Spending Score and make a 3D Visualization
